%% This is an example config file for an HTTP balancer (TCP port 80)
%% instead of a distcc server balancer.

%% The balancer app is expecting a list of "be" records.  However, the
%% Erlang record mechanism is kindof ugly and limited.  So, we create 
%% tuples here that look like "be" records, but we must be careful so
%% that each entry in the tuple matches an actual "be" record:
%%
%% 0. The atom 'be'
%% 1. A string containing a hostname or IP address
%% 2. The TCP port number
%% 3. The status atom 'up'
%% 4. The maximum number of simultaneous connections, >= 1.
%% 5. The number of pending connections, 0.
%% 6. The number of active connections, 0.
%% 7. The last error term, 'no_error'.
%% 8. The last error timestamp, 0.
%% 9. Activity counter, 0.
%% 10. Activity time counter, 0.
%% 11. Activity list, [].
